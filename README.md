Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This weeks challenge was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying a starter code, and runs in a browswer with updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery.
When the planner is opened, then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar, when the user scrolls down then they are presented with timeblocks for standard hours and can view the timeblocks which are color coded to indicate whether it is in the past present or future.

The timeblocks can have an event saved and is saved in local storage
